## Description: 
My personal project portfolio.

This portfolio was created using the bootstrap CSS framework. It was originally the UW Coding Bootcamp homework 2 but evolved beyond the scope of that homework alone. This portfolio has become a display case for projects completed by me that I am rather proud of. As this is updated, it will not just contain coding achievements but other projects I've completed.
