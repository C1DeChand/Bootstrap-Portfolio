# Cameron DeChand - Portfolio

## About:

This portfolio was created using the bootstrap CSS framework. It was originally the UW Coding Bootcamp homework 2 but evolved beyond the scope of that homework alone. This portfolio has become a display case for projects completed by me that I am rather proud of. As this is updated, it will not just contain coding achievements but other projects I've completed.

## Breakdown:

1. When the page initially loads up. My "About Me" page is displayed with a short bio and links to my GitHub Repo's, Linked In profile, and my (hopefully kept up to date) resume.
2. To view my projects, simply click the "Portfolio" link in the upper right of the screen on the navbar.
3. On the portfolio page you will find brief descriptions of the projects I've completed as well as an image link to that project.
4. For personal contact information. Click the "Contact" link on the navbar.
5. My email and phone number are listed on the contact page. PLEASE NOTE: I generally do not answer unknown phone numbers, please leave a message and I'll get back to you.
